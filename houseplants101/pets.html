<h1>Pet safety</h1>
<h3>How to protect our pets </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Plant toxicity</h3>
<p>Many plant owners also have pets, but did you know that many common houseplants are toxic to our furry friends? It’s true! Danger varies, but common houseplants like golden pothos, fig trees, monstera deliciosa, peace lily, anthurium, and more are all harmful to your pets if eaten. That doesn’t mean you can’t have those plants in your home at all, but it does mean you need to take precautions. If you can, keep toxic plants in rooms your pets don’t have access to, or place them where they can’t get to them. </p>
<br>
<h3>What about the non-toxic plants?</h3>
<p> Of course, there are plenty of wonderful plants that won’t hurt your pets at all. Prayer plants, palms, fittonia, polka-dot plant, cast iron plant, and many more are all perfectly safe for your furry friends, though they may still cough up the leaves later.</p>
<br>
<h3>How can i tell if my plant is toxic?</h3>
<p>Please check the ASPCA’s extensive list of toxic and non-toxic plants when considering bringing a plant into your home.</p>

        <p><b>About Us</b></p>
        <p>Hard working group of individuals looking to better the world through urban gardening. In a world where
            climate change is constantly becoming a reality it's important to make a difference where we can by
            educating the masses on how to do their part. We believe by helping people create their own gardens we can
            change the way people view sustainability and reduce our carbon footprint while helping others grow their
            own organic produce. </p>
