<h1>Plants and Mental Health</h1>
<h3>Benefits of Gardening on Mental Health</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Setting the mood</h3>
<p>Gardening has been shown to boost people’s moods by as much as some common types of exercise such as walking or riding a bike. This boost in mood is possible whether the person is alone or with someone, as well as on a small balcony or in a backyard lawn.</p>
<br>
<h3>Vegetable Gardens and their benefits</h3>
<p>Home vegetable gardening increases produce consumption and physical activity, but it’s also associated with improved emotional wellbeing. According to a recent study from Princeton University, out of 15 daily leisure activities including walking and biking, vegetable gardening is considered to be one of the most beneficial activities for mental and emotional health. This study also found that home gardening was the only activity studied that had a more substantial impact on emotional well being for women and people with lower incomes, compared to men and people with medium and high incomes</p>
<br>
<h3>Natural Environments</h3>
<p>Studies have also shown that humans are instinctively more at ease and relaxed within a natural environment, because of a base predisposition to understand and affiliate with nature</p>
