<h1>Composting</h1>
<br>
<h3>Benefits of Composting</h3>
<p>Composting is beneficial to not only your plants and gardens, but the environment. Less food waste ends up in landfills as the nutrients of that food enriches your soil and leads to lessoned need for chemical fertilizers. Composting also helps with the growth of beneficial bacteria and fungi that create humus from organic matter, a highly nutritious material. </p>
<br>
<h3>What Your Compost Needs</h3>
<p>All composting requires three basic ingredients:
    Browns - This includes materials such as dead leaves, branches, and twigs.
    Greens - This includes materials such as grass clippings, vegetable waste, fruit scraps, and coffee grounds.
    Water - Having the right amount of water, greens, and browns is important for compost development.
    </p>
    <br>
<h3>What to Compost</h3>
<p>Fruits and vegetables
    Eggshells
    Coffee grounds and filters
    Tea bags
    Nut shells
    Shredded newspaper
    Cardboard
    Paper
    Yard trimmings
    Grass clippings
    Houseplants
    Hay and straw
    Leaves
    Sawdust

    <h3>What not to compost</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Black walnut tree leaves or twigs</b> - Releases substances that might be harmful to plants
            Coal or charcoal ash
            </li>
        <li><b>Coal or charcoal ash</b> - Might contain substances harmful to plants</li>
        <li><b>Dairy products (e.g., butter, milk, sour cream, yogurt) and eggs*</b>- Create odor problems and attract pests such as rodents and flies
            Diseased or insect-ridden plants
            </li>
        <li><b>Fats, grease, lard, or oils*</b> - Create odor problems and attract pests such as rodents and flies
            Meat or fish bones and scraps
            </li>
        <li><b>Pet wastes (e.g., dog or cat feces, soiled cat litter)</b> - Might contain parasites, bacteria, germs, pathogens, and viruses harmful to humans</li>
        <li><b>Yard trimmings treated with chemical pesticides</b> - Might kill beneficial composting organisms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* Check with your local composting or recycling coordinator to see if these organics are accepted by your community curbside or drop-off composting program.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How to Compost at Home</h3>
    <p><b>Outside</b> - Select a dry, shady spot near a water source for your compost pile or bin.
        Add brown and green materials as they are collected, making sure larger pieces are chopped or shredded.
        Moisten dry materials as they are added.
        Once your compost pile is established, mix grass clippings and green waste into the pile and bury fruit and vegetable waste under 10 inches of compost material.
        Optional: Cover top of compost with a tarp to keep it moist. When the material at the bottom is dark and rich in color, your compost is ready to use. This usually takes anywhere between two months to two years.
