<h1>Growing Zones </h1>

<h3>What are Growing Zones?</h3>
<br>

<p>The US Department of Agriculture created the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map to provide a standard definition of climatic conditions relevant to plant growth and survival. It is used by the agriculture industry to define what plants grow best in what areas. By understanding what zone you’re located in, you can find out which plants will grow best in your area and which won’t.
</p>
<p>Planting zones tell us ultimately the temperature of the specific zone.  More specifically, they tell us when the average last frost will occur where you live - and the first frost. The number of days between first and last frost is your growing season. Planting zones give you an easy way to understand when to plant. Some vegetables can be planted before the last frost, some cannot. Squash, for example, is a summer vegetable that can not tolerate frost. So, starting your garden when there is a historical risk of frost can wipe out your garden.

        <p>Hard working group of individuals looking to better the world through urban gardening. In a world where
            climate change is constantly becoming a reality it's important to make a difference where we can by
