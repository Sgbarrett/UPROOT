<h1>Victory Gardens</h1>
<h3>Gardens were once promoted by the government to help with food rations. With climate change effecting the choices we make every day we believe that every one can do their part by creating their own Victory Garden.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is a Victory Garden?</h3>
<p>‘Victory gardens’ is the term used to define private homestead gardening and community gardening in the West during both World Wars. They were promoted by the governments to maintain a food supply for their citizens to ease the demand for rations and supplies during the wars. Victory gardens, albeit by a different name, is practiced in many other countries such as Vietnam. It has been re-adopted by the citizens in the West and explored at the turn of the 21st century.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Benefits on the Environment and Community</h3>
<p>The benefits these gardens provide are a reduced emissions and increased access to food. Especially in areas with community ‘victory’ gardens, families in poverty and in food deserts are more equipped to feed themselves and share resources with their neighborhood, while reducing the carbon emissions needed to provide food.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Best Practices for Starting and Maintaining a Victory Garden</h3>
<p><b>For a community garden:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Form a committee of people from your neighborhood to determine if there really is a need</li>
    <li>which demographics can help, and to whom the food is shared with.</li>
    <li>Decide on the rules and bylaws of this organization</li>
    <li>Select a garden site and secure access to grow on the land</li>
    <li>Clean the site and prepare the soil and plants</li>
</ul>
