        <p><b>About Us</b></p>
        <p>Hard working group of individuals looking to better the world through urban gardening. In a world where
            climate change is constantly becoming a reality it's important to make a difference where we can by
            educating the masses on how to do their part. We believe by helping people create their own gardens we can
            change the way people view sustainability and reduce our carbon footprint while helping others grow their
            own organic produce. </p>
