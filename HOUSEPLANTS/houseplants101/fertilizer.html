<h1>Fertilizer</h1>
<h3>Essential to providing plants with proper nutrients</h3>
<br>
<h3>Your plants need nutrients to grow and thrive.</h3>
<p> When you first get it from the garden center or order it from the greenhouse, it likely has been recently fertilized, so you don’t need to worry right away. Oftentimes, you don’t need to fertilize for as many as six months after purchase. When you repot a plant into the next size up, you add fresh soil to fill the space, which also delays the need to fertilize. Some plants may grow quickly enough that by the time you should start fertilizing after buying it, you already need to repot it, which brings in extra nutrients anyway.</p>
<br>
<h3>What is fertilizer?</h3>
<p>Regardless, you will need to fertilize eventually, so let’s break it down. Fertilizers are labeled with three numbers, say 10-10-10, which correspond to N (nitrogen), P (phosphorous), and K (potassium). These are the three main nutrients plants need. Most fertilizers will also have micronutrients listed on the package. Palm fertilizer, for example, should include trace amounts of boron for healthy growth. The first number, N, pertains to leaf growth, P is used for roots and reproduction, and K promotes the overall health of the plant.</p>
<br>
<h3>When should i fertilize?</h3>
<p>You should fertilize your plants during the growing season. If you live in a tropical or subtropical area, your growing season is all year! In more temperate regions, plants usually go dormant when it starts to get cold and don’t resume growth until the spring.</p>
<br>
<h3>Different Fertilizer forms</h3>
<p>Fertilizer comes in liquid and granular forms, as well as sticks or spikes and foliar sprays. Liquid and some granular fertilizers can be dissolved in the water you use for your plants, making fertilizing a breeze, provided your plants don’t have special needs.</p>
<br>
<h3>How much fertilizer?</h3>
<p>Your fertilizer package may recommend more than what your plants really need, especially if it has a high N-P-K concentration (10 or more). Consider cutting the recommended dose by half, especially at the beginning and end of the growing season.</p>
<br>
<h3>Whats the best option?</h3>
<p>To keep things simple, you can just use a balanced fertilizer where all three of the N-P-K values are the same. However, plants grown for their leaves may benefit from more N. Plants grown for the flowers should get more P. All plants, however, should get a good amount of K.</p>
