<h1>Landscaping</h1>
<h3>Creating a wonderful garden for your beautiful home.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Enhancing Your Landscape</h3>
<p>Landscaping projects are a considerable part of owning and maintaining a home today. These projects range from practical to decorative as homeowners explore their creative vision. People enjoy creating their own oasis, flush with a combination of man-made and natural beauty. Projects ranging from a complete yard makeover to simple plants and features all must start somewhere: in the imaginations of the homeowner. To make your vision come to life, there are a few things you need to learn.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Types of Landscaping Features</h3>
<p>Landscaping includes pretty much everything that comes to mind when you think of the outside of your home. Driveways, walkways, patios, fences, foundation plantings, and the lawn itself are all included. Other landscaping features to consider are planting beds, shrubs, trees, fountains, and ponds. While many features are functional and expected to come with a home, a good amount are left up to the design choices of the homeowner.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Where to Start</h3>
<p>The best place to start is always with a local landscaping expert. There are many things that go into a landscaping project and getting a consultation with a professional will lead to the most successful outcome. Once you have spoken with a landscaping expert, completing and maintaining your yard will be a lot easier, whether it be with the help of a hired team or on your own! </p>
