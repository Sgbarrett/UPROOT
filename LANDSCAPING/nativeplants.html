<h1>Native Plants</h1>
<h3>The wonderful plants that make up your local ecosystem.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Why Native Plants Matter</h3>
<p>Native plants are those that occur naturally in a region in which they evolved. They are a vital piece to the local ecosystem, with insect and animal life depending on them. Even humans depend on native plants in their area for food, medicine, building material, sun protection, among many other things. A thriving ecosystem leads to a healthy place for people, a beautiful environment, a force against climate change, and abundant wildlife. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Learning about your Climate and Habitat</h3>
<p>Learning about your region and local habitat is important when growing plants outside. Some species of plants will have better sustainability and a larger impact on the ecosystem than others. Some plants could even be harmful to the ecosystem, leading to the overtaking of native species of flora and fauna. Planting invasive species can have a detrimental effect overall as the species spreads and alters the local habitat. The best course of action is to Check your growing zone and to do your research on the native plants in your area. A great resource for this is your local plant nursery and a native plant finder which can be found by clicking the link below.</p>
